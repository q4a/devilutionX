# Installing

First, you will need access to the game MPQ files.
- First, locate `DIABDAT.MPQ` on your CD or in the GoG installation (or [extract it from the GoG installer](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki/Extracting-the-.MPQs-from-the-GoG-installer)).
- For the Diablo: Hellfire expansion you will also need `hellfire.mpq`, `hfmonk.mpq`, `hfmusic.mpq`, `hfvoice.mpq`.
- Lastly, DevilutionX comes with [devilutionx.mpq](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/raw/master/Packaging/resources/devilutionx.mpq) which you will also need.

Download the latest [DevilutionX release](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/releases) for your system (if available) and extract the contents to a location of your choosing, or [build from source](building.md). Then follow the system-specific instructions below.

<details><summary>Windows</summary>

- Copy the MPQ files to the folder containing the DevilutionX exe, or to the data folder. The data folder path may differ, but will normally be `%AppData%\diasurgical\devilution`
- Run `devilutionx.exe`

</details>

<details><summary>Linux</summary>

- Copy the MPQ files to the folder containing the DevilutionX executable, or to the data folder. The data folder path may differ depending on distro, version, and security settings, but will normally be `~/.local/share/diasurgical/devilution/`
- Install [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and [SDL2_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/):
 - Ubuntu/Debian/Rasbian `sudo apt install libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0`

- Run `./devilutionx`

</details>

<details><summary>Ubuntu PPA</summary>

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:devilutionx/stable
```

<details><summary>Nintendo Switch</summary>

- Copy `devilutionx.nro` and `CharisSILB.ttf` in into `/switch/devilutionx`

- Launch `devilutionx.nro` by holding R the installed game. Do not use the album to launch, if you use the album, the homebrew will only have a small amount of memory available, and the touch keyboard won't work. This is true for all homebrew, not just DevilutionX.

</details>

<details><summary>Android</summary>

- Copy the APK file to device and tap on it on device's file explorer or install via `adb install` (if USB debugging is enabled on device).
