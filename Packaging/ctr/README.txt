## Tips

- For improved performance, change the game's resolution to 640x480. This may be necessary on old 3DS models which may otherwise run slower than the game's intended framerate.
    - Open diablo.ini located in sd:/3ds/devilutionx.
    - Update Graphics settings by changing to `Width=640`.
    - By default, the game will scale to fill the entire top screen. To keep the aspect ratio when scaling, change to `Fit to Screen=0` in Graphics settings as well.
